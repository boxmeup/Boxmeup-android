> This is an intermediary app for a WIP react-native app to eventually replace.

The app is a wrapper for the web app (which has been rewritten in react) with the following features:

* Javascript interface that allows the react app to tap into native functions.
* Built in QR code reader (no requirement to install an additional app for end-users)
* Download handler that will handle:
  * Label Printing
  * CSV export
